# tracAR_MIC
AR movement-tracer application made during the Aalto Multitouch Interaction course.

The application is made to track dance movement in space and leave traces generated by the movement. The data that generates different behaviours is pulled from coreMotion (accelerometer, gyroscope & attitude sensors). This feeds into color, geometry shapes and rotational speed.

Controls:
- Hold ipad in portrait position
- Swipe up/down in the middle of the screen to control camera-feed brightness
- Hold ipad and touch the screen with thumbs on both sides of the screen to start logging data & generate geometry.

Now dance the night away!
